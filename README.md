# DeepfakeDetector

Have you ever been on https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/? Yes. That's right. That image is not a real person. How is it possible to detect such deepfake pictures, where even us real humans can't distiguish them? Well, lucky for us, this app can! Simply upload an image and this web app will tell you if the image is real or fake.

## Prerequisites

Install necessary python packages

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the Flask Application 

Run the **app.py** file from the **root** directory. 

`python app.py` 

Go to **localhost:5000** to access the application from the browser of your choice.
